Among the most popular types of photo booths, this booth-less photo station will involve a camera on a tripod or table. It might come with a background and props, or just the camera itself — then you can create your own custom backdrop. To use, your guest presses “start,” the countdown begins, and a few photos are taken. Some photo booth companies offer on the spot printouts, while others invite guests to input their phone numbers or email addresses to receive photos digitally.</div>

   	<div style="margin: 50px 20px 0px 50px;"><p style="font-family: Impact; font-size: 20px;">Curtain Photobooth</p>
   		Having a simple photo booth with just a curtain gives privacy to those who need it. Not everyone at a wedding would prefer to photograph themselves in front of a growing crowd.

The curtain theme can match the wedding, and the photo booth can be a simple design.

   	<div style="margin: 50px 20px 0px 50px;"><p style="font-family: Impact; font-size: 20px;">Retro Van Photobooth</p>
   		If someone you know has access to a retro van, you can easily turn it into a wedding photo booth for the day. You can dress it up, and park it wherever you need to. The camera can go in the passenger seat, while the small couch inside provides the guests with seating.

This is a perfect idea for bad weather weddings or one that doesn’t have a particularly interesting area to photograph in. The best thing is, you have your own ride to and from the wedding, providing you with a safe place for all your gear.

   	<div style="margin: 50px 20px 0px 50px;"><p style="font-family: Impact; font-size: 20px;">Chalkboard Photobooth</p>
   		A chalkboard is a very simple and cheap way to create a backdrop for a wedding photo booth. The design can be as interesting or as minimal as you prefer. The chalkboard adds texture, and works great as a theme for a marriage between teachers, for example.

Guests can write their own text, as long as you provide them with a damp cloth and chalk pieces.

   	<div style="margin: 50px 20px 0px 50px;"><p style="font-family: Impact; font-size: 20px;">Polaroid Frame</p>
   		Everyone loves Polaroid photographs, and the white border is synonymous with the instant prints. This is a very portable idea, allowing the guests to photograph each other in different places.

The best thing about this is you can design the text for under the image, using the names and date for the wedding. It is the small details that really make a wedding photo booth work.

   	<div style="margin: 50px 20px 0px 50px;"><p style="font-family: Impact; font-size: 20px;">Speech Bubbles for Wedding Photobooth</p>
   		Props are a great way to add a little humour to the wedding photo booth images. Things like speech bubbles can provide words to a still image, and the best thing is, you can make them say what you want.

Having a few different designs allows the guests to choose what they prefer. Having blank cards cut into the shape of speech bubbles means the guests can write personal messages.
